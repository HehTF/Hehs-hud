# Hehs-hud
current version of my hud it will be updated/changes will be made when I feel like it. it also has a crosshair pack. its hypnotizes if i remember corretly. you can modily the properties of the hud crosshair in the hud files resources -> crosshair -> crosshair.res  (at the time of this upload/release i have it enabled)


there probably is a better way to show you how this looks but for now there is a pictures folder

## An idea what this hud looks like so you dont have to waste your time looking thorugh the pictures section/downloading it and then doing it.

if the fonts dont work/load then you will have to manualy install them. go to the hud files then resources -> Fontit and install geosanslight.tff and young.tff

if the hud doesnt load after an updated. change the ui version to 4 in info.vdf

That RM button on the mainmenu is for reloading the Mainmenu(cant be botherd to take the hud editing tools out so th RM button will stay for now)


one more thing you want to edit this hud go for it IDC, but if you publish the edited version to other websites just be a decent person, dont claim it as your own and include the fact that it is an edited version of this hud. TY for your time.
