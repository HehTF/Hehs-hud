# Heh's hud
current version of my hud it will be updated/changes will be made when I feel like it. it also has a crosshair pack. its hypnotizes if i remember corretly. you can modily the properties of the hud crosshair in the hud files resources -> crosshair -> crosshair.res  (at the time of this upload/release i have it enabled)


the picture folder has more pics, i know what a surprise.

## An idea what this hud looks like so you dont have to waste your time looking thorugh the pictures section or downloading it and then doing it.

                                                          Troubleshooting?



if the fonts dont work/load then, you will have to manualy install them. go to the hud files then resources -> Fontit and install geosanslight.tff and young.tff

if the hud doesnt load after an update then, change the ui version to 4 in info.vdf (of course depending on what hud files the update touched some stuff might be broken)

That RM button on the mainmenu is for reloading it(cant be botherd to take the hud editing tools out/disable it so the RM button will stay for now)


one more thing if you want to edit this hud go for it IDC, but if you publish the edited or this one to other websites then just be a decent person, dont claim it as your own.
