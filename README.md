# Hehs-hud
current version of my hud it will be updated/changes will be made when I feel like it. it also has a crosshair pack. its hypnotizes if i remember corretly. you can modily the properties of the hud crosshair in the hud files resources -> crosshair -> crosshair.res  (at the time of this upload/release i have it enabled)


there probably is a better way to show you how this looks but for now there is a pictures folder


                            
An idea what this hud looks like so you dont have to waste your time looking thorugh the pictures section/downloading it and then doing it.

if the fonts dont work/load then you will have to manualy install them. go to the hud files then resources -> Fontit and install geosanslight.tff and young.tff

if the hud doesnt load after an updated. change the ui version to 4 in info.vdf
