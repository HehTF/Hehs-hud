# Hehs-hud
current version of my hud it will be updated/changes will be made when I feel like it. it also has a crosshair pack. its hypnotizes if i remember corretly. you can modily the properties of the hud crosshair in the hud files resources -> crosshair -> crosshair.res  (at the time of this upload/release i have it enabled)


there is probably a better way to show you how this thing looks but this will do for now(theres a folder called pictures)  





                                                          Troubleshooting 



if the fonts dont want to work/load then you will have to manualy install them. go to the hud files then resources -> Fontit and install geosanslight.tff and young.tff

if the hud doesnt load after an updated. change the ui version to 4 in info.vdf. that should do the trick.
